This is a Metal based HTML page implementing media queries and the t.r.g.(tiny responsive grid). I implemented media queries which adjusted the size of my images, but you can apply it to any html/css really. I also implemented Tiny Responsive Grid which can make your properties stack after you shrink your screen down. I implemented a navigation hamburger as well. I will definitely be learning how to use these technologies much better.
